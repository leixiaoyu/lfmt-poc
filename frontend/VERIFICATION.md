# Authentication UI Verification Guide

This guide explains how to verify and test the completed Phase 3 authentication features.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

### 2. Navigate Through the Application

The app will automatically redirect you to the login page at `/login`.

## Feature Verification Checklist

### ✅ Login Page (`/login`)

**Location:** `http://localhost:5173/login`

**What to Test:**

1. **Form Rendering:**
   - [ ] Email input field is visible
   - [ ] Password input field is visible
   - [ ] "Log In" button is visible
   - [ ] "Forgot Password?" link is visible
   - [ ] "Sign Up" link is visible

2. **Email Validation:**
   - [ ] Submit empty form → "Email is required" error appears
   - [ ] Enter invalid email (e.g., "test") → "Invalid email address" error
   - [ ] Error clears when you start typing

3. **Password Validation:**
   - [ ] Submit with empty password → "Password is required" error

4. **Loading State:**
   - [ ] Click submit with valid data → Button shows "Logging in..." with spinner
   - [ ] Button is disabled during submission

5. **Navigation:**
   - [ ] Click "Forgot Password?" → Redirects to `/forgot-password`
   - [ ] Click "Sign Up" → Redirects to `/register`

6. **Form Submission:**
   - Enter email: `test@example.com`
   - Enter password: `Password123!`
   - Click "Log In"
   - Expected: Mock authentication succeeds, redirects to `/dashboard`

### ✅ Register Page (`/register`)

**Location:** `http://localhost:5173/register`

**What to Test:**

1. **Form Rendering:**
   - [ ] First Name field (left side on desktop)
   - [ ] Last Name field (right side on desktop)
   - [ ] Email field
   - [ ] Password field
   - [ ] Confirm Password field
   - [ ] "Sign Up" button

4. **Password Strength Validation:**
   Test each requirement individually:
   - [ ] Enter "short" → "Password must be at least 8 characters"
   - [ ] Enter "lowercase123!" → "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter"
   - [ ] Enter "UPPERCASE123!" → "Password must contain at least one lowercase letter"
   - [ ] Enter "NoNumbers!" → "Password must contain at least one number"
   - [ ] Enter "NoSpecial123" → "Password must contain at least one special character"
   - [ ] Enter "ValidPass123!" → No password error

5. **Password Confirmation:**
   - [ ] Password: "Password123!", Confirm: "Different123!" → "Passwords do not match"
   - [ ] Matching passwords → No confirm error

6. **Responsive Layout:**
   - [ ] Desktop (>600px): First/Last name side by side
   - [ ] Mobile (<600px): First/Last name stack vertically

7. **Form Submission:**
   - Fill all fields correctly:
     - First Name: `John`
     - Last Name: `Doe`
     - Email: `john.doe@example.com`

### ✅ Dashboard Page (`/dashboard`) - Protected

**Location:** `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`

**What to Test:**

   - [ ] Try to access `/dashboard` → Redirects back to `/login` (no longer authenticated)

4. **Direct URL Access:**
   - [ ] While logged out, try accessing `/dashboard` directly
   - [ ] Expected: Immediate redirect to `/login`

### ✅ Routing and Navigation

**What to Test:**

1. **Default Route:**
   - [ ] Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` → Redirects to `/login`

2. **404 Handling:**
   - [ ] Navigate to `/nonexistent-page` → Redirects to `/login`

3. **Route Transitions:**
   - [ ] All navigation is instant (client-side routing)
   - [ ] No full page reloads when navigating

4. **Browser Navigation:**
   - [ ] Back/Forward buttons work correctly
   - [ ] URL updates as you navigate

### ✅ Material-UI Theme

**What to Test:**

1. **Visual Consistency:**
   - [ ] All pages use consistent colors
   - [ ] All buttons have the same style
   - [ ] All form fields use the same design
   - [ ] Paper elevation (shadow) on form containers

2. **Button Styling:**
   - [ ] Buttons have no text-transform (should be "Log In" not "LOG IN")
   - [ ] Primary buttons are blue (#1976d2)
   - [ ] Buttons have rounded corners (8px border radius)

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - [ ] Mobile: Forms are full width with padding
   - [ ] Desktop: Forms are centered with max width
   - [ ] All pages are mobile-friendly

## Testing with Mock Data

Since the backend is not yet implemented, the application uses mock authentication:

### Mock User Credentials (AuthContext)

The AuthContext is configured to accept ANY credentials for testing purposes.

**To simulate successful login:**
- Email: any valid email format (e.g., `test@example.com`)
- Password: any non-empty string (e.g., `password`)

**Mock user data returned:**
```json
{
  "id": "mock-user-id",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "firstName": "Test",
  "lastName": "User"
}
```

### Expected Behavior with Mock Data

1. **Login:** Always succeeds with any email/password
2. **Register:** Always succeeds with valid form data
3. **Forgot Password:** Always succeeds with valid email
4. **Session Persistence:** User session persists in localStorage
5. **Logout:** Clears session and redirects to login

## Automated Test Verification

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ src/services/__tests__/authService.test.ts  (17 tests)
✓ src/contexts/__tests__/AuthContext.test.tsx  (16 tests)
✓ src/utils/__tests__/api.test.ts  (12 tests)
✓ src/components/Auth/__tests__/LoginForm.test.tsx  (19 tests)
✓ src/components/Auth/__tests__/ForgotPasswordForm.test.tsx  (20 tests)
✓ src/components/Auth/__tests__/RegisterForm.test.tsx  (27 tests)

Test Files  6 passed (6)
     Tests  111 passed (111)
```

### Run TypeScript Type Check

```bash
cd frontend
npm run type-check
```

**Expected Output:**
```
> tsc --noEmit

(No output means success - 0 errors)
```

### Run Linting

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

## Known Limitations (Mock Mode)

1. **No Real Authentication:** All credentials are accepted
2. **No Backend Validation:** Form validation is client-side only
3. **No Password Reset Emails:** Forgot password flow shows success but sends no email
4. **Session Storage Only:** User session stored in localStorage (not secure for production)
5. **No Token Refresh:** Access tokens don't expire in mock mode

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Port 5173 already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Kill the process using port 5173
lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9

# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- --port 3000
```

### Issue: Module not found errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors in IDE

**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart TypeScript server in VS Code
# Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

# Or rebuild
npm run type-check
```

### Issue: Tests failing

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear test cache
npm test -- --clearCache

# Run tests again
npm test
```

## Accessibility Testing

### Keyboard Navigation

1. **Tab Through Forms:**
   - [ ] Tab key moves through all form fields in logical order
   - [ ] Enter key submits forms
   - [ ] Links are keyboard accessible

2. **Focus Indicators:**
   - [ ] All interactive elements show focus outline
   - [ ] Focus outline is visible and clear

3. **Screen Reader:**
   - [ ] All form fields have proper labels
   - [ ] Error messages are announced
   - [ ] Button states are announced

### ARIA Compliance

All form components use Material-UI which provides:
- Proper ARIA labels
- ARIA-describedby for error messages
- Role attributes
- Accessible names

## Performance Verification

### Lazy Loading

1. **Check Network Tab:**
   - [ ] Open DevTools → Network tab
   - [ ] Navigate to `/login`
   - [ ] Only LoginPage chunk is loaded
   - [ ] Navigate to `/register`
   - [ ] RegisterPage chunk loads on demand

### Bundle Size

```bash
npm run build
```

Check the build output for chunk sizes. Each page should be code-split.

## Next Steps After Verification

Once you've verified all features work correctly:

1. ✅ Authentication UI is production-ready (client-side)
2. 🔄 Ready for backend integration when auth APIs are available
3. 🔄 Can proceed to implement dashboard features
4. 🔄 Can add additional protected routes as needed

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter any unexpected behavior:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
3. Ensure you're using Node.js 18+ (`node --version`)
4. Clear browser cache and localStorage
5. Try incognito/private mode to rule out extension conflicts
