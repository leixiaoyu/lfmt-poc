# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## ✅ Repository Status

**GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/leixiaoyu/lfmt-poc.git  
**Local Repository**: Configured and ready to push  
**Remote Origin**: Added and configured  

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Push Code to GitHub

### Option 1: Automated Setup Script (Recommended)
```bash
# Run our automated setup script
./scripts/setup-github.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/raymondl/Documents/LFMT POC/LFMT/lfmt-poc"

# Push to GitHub (you'll be prompted for authentication)
git push -u origin main
```

### Option 3: If Authentication Issues
If you get authentication errors, try these solutions:

#### Solution A: GitHub CLI (Easiest)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
# brew install gh  # (on macOS)

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

#### Solution B: Personal Access Token
1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Create a new token with `repo` permissions
3. Use token as password when prompted:
   ```bash
   Username: leixiaoyu
   Password: [your-personal-access-token]
   ```

#### Solution C: SSH (Most Secure)
```bash
# Generate SSH key if you don't have one
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Add SSH key to GitHub account
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy output and add to GitHub → Settings → SSH keys

# Change remote URL to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:leixiaoyu/lfmt-poc.git

# Push code
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After successful push, verify:

1. **Visit GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/leixiaoyu/lfmt-poc
2. **Check Files Present**:
   - ✅ README.md
   - ✅ .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
   - ✅ backend/infrastructure/
   - ✅ shared-types/
   - ✅ docs/
   - ✅ scripts/

3. **Verify CI/CD Pipeline**: 
   - Go to "Actions" tab in GitHub
   - You should see the workflow trigger automatically

## ⚡ What Happens After Push

### Automatic CI/CD Pipeline Triggers
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:

1. **✅ Code Validation**: TypeScript compilation, linting
2. **🧪 Run Tests**: Infrastructure validation (38 test cases)
3. **🔒 Security Scan**: Check for secrets and vulnerabilities
4. **📦 CDK Synthesis**: Generate CloudFormation templates
5. **⚠️ Deployment Will Fail**: Because AWS credentials aren't configured yet

This is **expected** - the pipeline will fail at the deployment step because we haven't set up AWS credentials in GitHub Secrets yet.

## 📋 Next Immediate Steps (After Push)

### 1. Set Up Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)
In your GitHub repository:
- Go to Settings → Branches
- Add rule for `main` branch:
  - ✅ Require status checks to pass
  - ✅ Require up-to-date branches
  - ✅ Include administrators

### 2. Configure GitHub Environments
In your GitHub repository:
- Go to Settings → Environments
- Create environments: `development`, `staging`, `production`
- Set up approval requirements for staging/production

### 3. Prepare for AWS Credentials Setup
We'll need to configure these GitHub Secrets:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_PROD` (for production)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_PROD` (for production)

## 🎯 Status After GitHub Push

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Repository Created | ✅ Complete | https://github.com/leixiaoyu/lfmt-poc |
| Local Git Configured | ✅ Complete | Remote origin added |
| Code Push | 🔄 In Progress | Waiting for your push |
| CI/CD Pipeline | 🔄 Ready | Will trigger after push |
| AWS Credentials | ⚠️ Pending | Next critical step |
| Infrastructure Deployment | ⚠️ Pending | After AWS setup |

## 🚨 Issues & Solutions

### Common Push Issues

**Issue**: `fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com'`
**Solution**: Use GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`) or Personal Access Token

**Issue**: `Permission denied (publickey)`
**Solution**: Set up SSH keys or use HTTPS with Personal Access Token

**Issue**: `Updates were rejected because the remote contains work`
**Solution**: This shouldn't happen with a fresh repo, but if it does:
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Check remote configuration
git remote -v

# Check branch status
git branch -a

# Check last commit
git log --oneline -1

# Check repository status
git status
```

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
1. **GitHub repository shows all files** (24 files should be visible)
2. **Actions tab shows workflow running** (may fail at AWS deploy step - that's expected)
3. **README.md displays properly** with project overview
4. **File structure is complete** with backend/, frontend/, shared-types/, etc.

**🎯 Once you've successfully pushed the code, let me know and we'll move to the next critical step: AWS credentials configuration!**

The foundation is solid and we're ready for immediate deployment once AWS access is configured! 🚀
