## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks

**LOW Risk**:
- **Chunking Performance at Scale**: Large documents (400K words) may have long processing times
  - *Mitigation*: Chunk generation tested up to 25K tokens, performance within acceptable range
  - *Current*: Average 3,125 tokens per chunk with minimal overhead
  - *Timeline*: Monitor production performance

- **AWS Cost Overruns**: Monthly AWS costs could exceed budget
  - *Mitigation*: CloudWatch alarms configured, cost monitoring in place
  - *Current*: Minimal spend (no translation jobs processed yet)
  - *Timeline*: Ongoing monitoring

- **Claude API Rate Limiting**: High-volume translation jobs may hit rate limits
  - *Mitigation*: Rate limiting logic planned, exponential backoff ready
  - *Timeline*: Implement in Phase 6

### Resolved Risks
- ✅ **AWS Deployment Permissions**: Resolved - infrastructure deployed successfully
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: Resolved - GitHub Actions fully operational
- ✅ **Lambda Function Implementation**: Resolved - all auth functions deployed
- ✅ **Frontend-Backend Integration**: Resolved - upload service fully integrated
- ✅ **Test Coverage Gaps**: Resolved - 492+ tests with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ **Upload→Chunking Workflow**: Resolved - S3 event-driven architecture implemented

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. Comprehensive testing at each phase
2. Incremental deployment (dev → staging → prod)
3. Rollback procedures documented
4. Monitoring and alerting configured
5. Regular progress reviews and course corrections

## Recent Updates (November 2025)

### Rate Limiter Timezone Fix - PR #31 (2025-11-03)
**Status**: ✅ Merged
**Pull Request**: https://github.com/leixiaoyu/lfmt-poc/pull/31

#### Problem
- Rate limiter tests were failing in CI (7 RPD test failures)
- Root cause: `toLocaleString()` timezone handling inconsistency between local and CI environments
- Failed tests: "should allow requests within RPD limit", "should enforce daily request limit", etc.

#### Solution
- Replaced `toLocaleString()` with `date-fns-tz` library for reliable timezone handling
- Used `toZonedTime()` and `fromZonedTime()` for accurate Pacific timezone calculations
- Fixed 7 AWS SDK TypeScript type errors (added explicit `XxxCommandOutput` types)

#### Files Modified
- `backend/functions/translation/rateLimiter.ts` - Timezone calculation fix
- 7 files with AWS SDK type errors (auth, chunking, jobs, translation)
- `backend/functions/__tests__/integration/helpers/test-helpers.ts` - Type inference fix

#### Impact
- ✅ All 7 RPD tests now passing
- ✅ All 296 backend tests passing (209 unit + rest)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline fully green

### E2E Test ES Module Fix - PR #32 (2025-11-03)
**Status**: ✅ Merged
**Pull Request**: https://github.com/leixiaoyu/lfmt-poc/pull/32

#### Problem
- E2E tests failing on main branch with `ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined in ES module scope`
- Error in `frontend/e2e/tests/translation/upload-workflow.spec.ts`
- Root cause: Frontend uses `"type": "module"` in package.json, making all files ES modules

#### Solution
- Added ES module equivalent of `__dirname` using `import.meta.url`:
  ```typescript
  import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
  import { dirname } from 'path';

  const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
  const __dirname = dirname(__filename);
  ```

#### Files Modified
- `frontend/e2e/tests/translation/upload-workflow.spec.ts`

#### Impact
- ✅ E2E tests fixed for ES module compatibility
- ✅ Main branch CI/CD should now pass
- ✅ No other `__dirname` usage found in E2E tests

#### Key Learning
- **Branch Protection**: Discovered main branch requires all changes via pull requests (no direct pushes)
- **Senior Engineer Approach**: Fixed ALL failing tests (not just related code) before creating PR
- **CI/CD Hygiene**: Ensured pre-push validation catches these issues locally

### Translation Engine Decision - Issue #13 Resolution (2025-11-03)
**Status**: ✅ Resolved - Using Gemini 1.5 Pro for POC Phase
**Related Issues**: #13 (Engine Inconsistency), #22 (Missing Step Functions)

#### Decision Context
- Team lead (xlei-raymond) prioritized P0 blockers in project_priorities_proposal.md
- Two critical issues identified:
  1. **Issue #13**: Documentation specified Claude Sonnet 4 (~$700/month) but code implemented GEMINI_API_KEY_SECRET_NAME
  2. **Issue #22**: Missing Step Functions orchestrator preventing end-to-end translation

#### Resolution: Use Gemini 1.5 Pro for POC
**Rationale**:
- **Cost Priority**: User explicitly prioritized cost over quality for POC phase (<$50/month target)
- **Free Tier**: Gemini free tier (5 RPM, 250K TPM, 25 RPD) provides sufficient capacity for POC
- **Already Implemented**: Rate limiter (`backend/functions/translation/rateLimiter.ts`) already uses Gemini limits
- **Quality Can Improve Later**: Architecture is engine-agnostic; can upgrade to Claude Sonnet 4 if quality requirements increase
- **Actual Cost**: ~$0 for POC using free tier vs ~$30-40/month for Claude

#### Impact
- ✅ Updated README.md to document Gemini as POC engine
- ✅ Updated DEVELOPMENT-ROADMAP.md with Gemini references
- ✅ Updated PROGRESS.md cost model with Gemini free tier details
- ✅ Maintained architecture flexibility for future Claude migration
- 🔄 Next: Implement Step Functions orchestrator (Issue #22)

#### Testing Requirements
- Load test with at least one 400K word document (user requirement)
- Validate rate limiting compliance (5 RPM free tier)
- Monitor token usage to stay within free tier limits
- Track cost as ~$0 for POC phase

#### GitHub Issue Status
- **Issue #13**: ✅ Resolved - [Comment posted](https://github.com/leixiaoyu/lfmt-poc/issues/13#issuecomment-3483175055)
- **Issue #22**: 🔄 In Progress - [Comment posted](https://github.com/leixiaoyu/lfmt-poc/issues/22#issuecomment-3483175339)

### Step Functions Implementation - Phase 6 (2025-11-03)
**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Implementing Translation Orchestration
**Related Issues**: #22 (Missing Step Functions orchestrator)

#### Current Task: Define Step Functions State Machine
Implementing production-ready orchestration workflow to enable end-to-end document translation.

**Planned State Machine Architecture**:
- **Map State**: Iterate through all document chunks sequentially
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Progress Tracking**: Update DynamoDB job status after each chunk
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Gemini free tier limits (5 RPM, 250K TPM)
- **Completion Detection**: Mark job as COMPLETED when all chunks translated

**State Flow**:
```
Start → Validate Job → Load Metadata
  → Map State (For Each Chunk):
      → Check Rate Limits
      → Translate Chunk (invoke Lambda)
      → Update Progress in DynamoDB
  → All Chunks Complete → Update Final Status → End
```

**IAM Permissions Required**:
- Step Functions invoke Lambda
- Step Functions read/write DynamoDB
- Lambda access to S3 chunks and translations
