**Q6: Do you have AWS credentials configured?**
```bash
# Test with this command:
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
- [ ] Yes, it shows my account information
- [ ] No, I need to configure credentials

**If NO, you'll need to:**
1. Create an IAM user with programmatic access

### 3. AWS CDK Bootstrap

**Q7: Is your AWS account bootstrapped for CDK?**
```bash
# Check if bootstrap stack exists:
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name CDKToolkit --region YOUR_REGION 2>/dev/null
```
- [ ] Yes, CDKToolkit stack exists
- [ ] No, I need to bootstrap

**If NO, you'll need to run:**
```bash
cd backend/infrastructure
npx cdk bootstrap aws://YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/YOUR_REGION
```

---

### 4. Cost & Budget

**Q8: What is your monthly budget for this POC?**
- Budget: $`______` per month
- **Recommended**: $60/month (covers development and light testing)

**Q9: Should we set up cost alerts?**
- [ ] Yes, alert me when costs exceed `___`% of budget (recommend 80%)
- [ ] No, I'll monitor costs manually

**Q10: What email should receive cost alerts?**
- Email: `____________@____________`

**Expected Costs (Development Environment):**
- DynamoDB: $2-5/month (on-demand)
- S3: $1-3/month
- API Gateway: $3-10/month
- Lambda: $0-2/month (generous free tier)
- Cognito: FREE (up to 50K users)
- CloudWatch: $1-2/month
- **Total**: ~$7-20/month (before Claude API costs)

---

### 5. Environment Strategy

**Q11: Which environments do you want to deploy?**
- [ ] Development only (for testing)
- [ ] Development + Staging
- [ ] Development + Staging + Production

**Q12: What should be the stack name for development?**
- Stack name: `____________` (default: `lfmt-dev`)
- This will prefix all AWS resources: `lfmt-dev-jobs`, `lfmt-dev-api`, etc.

**Q13: Do you want to enable data retention in development?**
- [ ] No, delete all data when stack is destroyed (recommended for dev)
- [ ] Yes, retain DynamoDB and S3 data even after stack deletion

---

### 6. Domain & CORS Configuration

**Q14: Do you have a custom domain for this application?**
- [ ] Yes: `____________`
- [ ] No, I'll use the API Gateway default URL

**Q15: What origin(s) should be allowed for CORS?**
- Development: `http://localhost:3000` (already configured)
- Production: `____________` (if you have a custom domain)

---

### 7. Cognito Configuration

**Q16: What email should Cognito use for verification emails?**
- [ ] Use Cognito default (no-reply@verificationemail.com)
- [ ] Custom email: `____________@____________` (requires SES verification)

**Q17: Do you want users to self-register?**
- [ ] Yes, allow public registration (already configured)
- [ ] No, admin-only user creation

**Q18: Password policy:**
- Current policy (already configured):
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Requires uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- [ ] Keep current policy
- [ ] Custom policy: `____________`

---

### 8. Docker Availability (For Lambda Bundling)

**Q19: Do you have Docker installed and running?**
```bash
# Test with:
docker --version
docker ps
```
- [ ] Yes, Docker is installed and running
- [ ] No, I need to install Docker

**Why Docker is needed:**
- CDK uses Docker to bundle Lambda functions with dependencies
- Required for `cdk synth` and `cdk deploy`

**If NO:**
- Install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Alternative: Use pre-built Lambda layers (more complex)

---

### 9. Deployment Preferences

**Q20: How do you want to deploy?**
- [ ] **Option A**: Manual deployment from my machine (I'll run `cdk deploy`)
- [ ] **Option B**: Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions (push to deploy)
- [ ] **Option C**: Guided deployment with step-by-step instructions

**Q21: Do you want to deploy now or review the CloudFormation template first?**
- [ ] Deploy now (I trust the infrastructure code)
- [ ] Show me the template first (`cdk synth` output)
- [ ] I want to review and approve each resource

---

### 10. GitHub Repository (For CI/CD - Optional)

**Q22: Is your code pushed to GitHub?**
- [ ] Yes, repository: https://github.com/`____________`/`____________`
- [ ] No, it's only local
- [ ] I don't want to use GitHub

**Q23: If using GitHub Actions, should we configure AWS credentials now?**
- [ ] Yes, I want automated deployments
- [ ] No, manual deployments only

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT COMMAND

Once all questions are answered and prerequisites are met:

```bash
# Navigate to infrastructure directory
cd backend/infrastructure

# Synthesize CloudFormation template (test)
npx cdk synth --context environment=dev

# Deploy to AWS (requires confirmation)
npx cdk deploy --context environment=dev

# Deploy without confirmation prompts
npx cdk deploy --context environment=dev --require-approval never
```

**Estimated deployment time**: 5-10 minutes

### API Endpoint Testing
```bash
# Get API URL from stack outputs
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name lfmt-dev --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='ApiUrl'].OutputValue" --output text

# Test registration endpoint
curl -X POST https://YOUR_API_URL/v1/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "TestPass123!",
    "confirmPassword": "TestPass123!",
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "User",
