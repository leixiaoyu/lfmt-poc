## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow
- **Main Branch**: `main` - Production-ready code with branch protection
- **Feature Branches**: `feature/description` - Individual features
- **Pull Requests**: Required for all changes to main
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing on all PRs

### Branch Protection Rules
- Require pull request before merging
- Require status checks to pass (Run Tests, Build Infrastructure)
- Require conversation resolution
- No direct pushes to main

### Commit Messages
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, ci
**Scopes**: auth, docs, api, ui, infra, deploy, security

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- 90%+ test coverage required
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- Pre-commit hooks for validation
- Security-first development practices

## Testing

### Infrastructure Tests
```bash
cd backend/infrastructure
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage report
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
cd frontend
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm run test:coverage      # Coverage report
npm run test:ui            # Interactive test UI
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Tests
All pull requests automatically run:
- Shared-types validation
- Function unit tests with coverage
- Infrastructure TypeScript compilation
- Infrastructure tests
- Linting and format checks
- Security audits (npm audit)

## Documentation

- **[Production Setup Checklist](PRODUCTION-SETUP-CHECKLIST.md)** - Complete production deployment guide
- **[Production Deployment Guide](PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)** - Detailed deployment procedures
- **[Production Security](PRODUCTION-SECURITY-DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Optional security enhancements

- **[Technical Architecture v2](../Long-Form%20Translation%20Service%20-%20Technical%20Architecture%20Design%20v2.0.md)** - High-level architecture

## Monitoring & Observability

### CloudWatch Dashboards
- API Gateway metrics (latency, errors, requests)
- Lambda function performance (duration, errors, throttles)
- DynamoDB metrics (read/write capacity, throttles)
- S3 storage utilization and costs

### Cost Monitoring
- AWS Budget configured ($100/month for production)
- CloudWatch alarms for cost thresholds
- Resource tagging for cost allocation
- Monthly cost reports

### Alerts (Configured)
- API Gateway error rate > 5%
- Lambda function errors > 1%
- DynamoDB throttling events

## Security

### Data Protection
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- **Access Control**: IAM roles with least-privilege principles
- **Authentication**: Cognito with strong password policies (min 8 chars, complexity requirements)
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager integration (planned)
- **OIDC**: GitHub Actions uses OIDC for secure AWS access (no static credentials)

### Security Features
- Branch protection on main branch
- Required pull request reviews
- Automated security scanning (npm audit)
- Pre-push validation hooks
- Secret scanning enabled
- All production credentials redacted from documentation

### Compliance
- Legal attestation system (planned)
- Audit trails for all user actions (planned)
- 7-year data retention for legal compliance (planned)
- GDPR compliance considerations

## Cost Optimization

### Current Estimates (Monthly)
- **Development**: ~$10-20/month
- **Staging**: ~$15-30/month
- **Production**: ~$30-50/month (target for 1000 translations)

### Optimization Features
- DynamoDB on-demand billing
- S3 intelligent tiering and lifecycle policies
- Lambda ARM64 for 20% cost reduction
- API Gateway caching to reduce Lambda invocations
- Automated resource cleanup

## Support

### Getting Help
- Check documentation in root directory
- Review implementation plan for current status
